# Memory game inspired by Simon Game #

## Hello and thank you for reading this page and give a try to this game.

So, from the three projects I have chosen to build a game inspired by Simon Game.
First I had to decide what do i need to make this project work.

From looking at an online version of the game I needed first to get done the following:

I needed four buttons programmed to change colours in a random sequence and record the sequence and  a way for the player to match the sequence.I also decided to make the game to
play one sequence at a time and wait for player input and after that to validate the result.
The player could after that play the next sequence.This I felt gives the player some time to prepare for the next sequence when the game gets really hard and also to take a short break anytime.
For the JS code, I've decided to use vanilla Javascript .I needed a way to make the buttons to change colors and to record it. I've chosen to use css classes for that.


## HTML:
 I have decided to use Bootstrap for responsive design although there is the grid option available , but i am more familiar with the Bootstrap.
 I have created three divs that would collapse for smaller devices, one being the
 main div containing the circle divided in four that represents the playable area.
 The second div would be a display area for a main start button and two divs to display
 a timer and player's score.
